I'm an ecophysiologist at the <a href='https://eeb.utoronto.ca'>Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology</a>, University of Toronto, Canada. I'm doing a PhD with Prof. Rowan Sage. I received my BSc from Western University, where I worked with Prof. Norm HÃ¼ner on photosynthesis in boreal trees grown under high temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.

The goal of my PhD research is to gain mechanistic understanding into the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, a key innovation in flowering plants that enabled diversification into warm and semi-arid habitats. C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis involves modifications to primary metabolic pathways which are typically under purifying or neutral selection, yet it has has evolved over 60 times independently. Thus, plant lineages containing C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate, and C<sub>4</sub> species are unique study systems that allow the integration of physiology, ecology, and evolution to study how ecosystems were assembled in the last ~30 million years.
