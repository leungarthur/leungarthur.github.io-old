I'm a PhD student at the <a href='https://eeb.utoronto.ca'>Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology</a>, University of Toronto, Canada. I'm working with Prof. Rowan Sage on the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, a key innovation in flowering plants that promoted diversification into warm and semi-arid habitats. I am interested in clarifying the environmental factors and physiological mechanisms that facilitated C<sub>4</sub> evolution. I received my BSc from Western University, where I worked with Prof. Norm HÃ¼ner on photosynthesis in boreal trees grown under high temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.
