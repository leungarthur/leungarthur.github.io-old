I'm an ecophysiologist at the <a href='https://eeb.utoronto.ca'>Dept. of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology</a>, University of Toronto, Canada. I'm doing a PhD with Prof. Rowan Sage. I received my BSc from Western University, where I worked with Prof. Norm HÃ¼ner on photosynthesis in boreal trees grown under high temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.

The goal of my PhD research is to gain mechanistic understanding into the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, a key innovation in flowering plants that enabled diversification into warm and semi-arid habitats. C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis involves modifications to primary metabolic pathways which are typically under purifying or neutral selection, accompanied with drastic changes to leaf anatomy and ultrastructure. These modifications enable the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> around the enzyme rubisco to improve photosynthetic performance. Despite the complexity of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, it has evolved over 60 times independently. C<sub>4</sub> plants have been a significant part of semi-arid vegetation, providing food to herbivores and early humans. Thus, plant lineages containing C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate, and C<sub>4</sub> species are exciting and unique study systems that allow the integration of physiology, ecology, and evolution to study how ecosystems were assembled in recent geological time.

The study of C<sub>4</sub> evolution also benefits humanity, because maize, which is one of our most productive crops, uses C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. By studying the phenotypic building blocks of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, the C<sub>4</sub> community has made significant steps towards engineering crops that will meet our growing nutritional demands in a warming world.
