It's common to see C<sub>4</sub> leaves that are more tightly packed than C<sub>3</sub> relatives. Something I haven't seen people talk about is how less IAS contact means more contact to other cells.

At a constant density of plasmodesmata, more area in contact between cells means a greater total number of plasmodesmata between cells. This should increase the conductance of metabolites between cells, which should increase the efficiency of C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.

This may be important to engineering an efficient biochemical CCM into a C<sub>3</sub> leaf!
