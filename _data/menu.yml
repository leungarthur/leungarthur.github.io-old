      - title: The goal of my PhD research is to gain mechanistic understanding into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a key innovation in flowering plants that enabled diversification into warm and semi-arid habitats. C4 photosynthesis involves modifications to primary metabolic pathways which are typically under purifying or neutral selection, yet it has has evolved over 60 times independently. Thus, it is a unique study system that allows the integration of physiology, ecology, and evolution for insights into how the biosphere was assembled in the last ~30 million years.
